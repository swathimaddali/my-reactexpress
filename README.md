My Online Application using React/Express
This repository has the code to support a tutorial that I created on Medium called Create a React FrontEnd, a Node/Express BackEnd and connect them together.
This repository can also be used as a starting point (boilerplate), if you whant to create your own React/Express app. .

Create a React FrontEnd, a Node/Express BackEnd and connect them together
There are two separated apps. The Client which serves the FrontEnd (using React), and the API (in Node/Express).

How to run the API
In your terminal, navigate to the api directory.
Run npm install to install all dependencies.
Run npm start to start the app.
How to run the Client
In another terminal, navigate to the client directory.
Run npm install to install all dependencies.
Run npm start to start the app
Check if they are connected
With the two apps running, open your browser in http://localhost:3000/.
If you see a webpage saying Welcome to React, it means the FrontEnd is working.
If the same webpage has the phrase API is working properly, it means the API is working.
Enjoy!
